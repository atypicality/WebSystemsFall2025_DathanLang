#PROMPTS THAT I USED:

I want you to create the html section for a weather app that queries from openweather api and make sure when you press it, have it connect with a different api relating to anime characters

can you make sure that when it generates the text that it does it in one-two sentences so it doesnt cut out. Also can you make sure this is in units of the country we have chosen (ie america and imperial)

how can i make the anime generator be more related to the weather

can you make it so you get characters that have powers or origins relating to the weather and post your code below

can you add margins from the top and bottom and also add a summary of how the character and weather are related

can you guarantee that the temperature is correct sometimes its way too hot or cold

can you update the whole code please

your code provides the summary but has the wrong description, it uses a different character than the one shown, please correct and replace the whole code

the ids are wrong for instance you have ace but naruto shows up for the image

it seems that you havent fix the names can we instead just sear for anime characters whos names are similar to the weather

when its cloudy it choses a character that doesnt exist can you choose another one

can you replace the whole code please

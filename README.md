# ITWS2110-S25-Lab 1 | Dathan Lang 

## Background
Hey welcome to my resume/website! I'm Dathan and I'm a
second-year CS and ITWS dual student @ RPI. I'm interested
in a bunch of things like Scrabble, Jazz and Anime. This
is my labs repository for ITWS 2110 for Fall 2025.

## Process and Struggles
For this project I spent most of my time just researching css styling and 
attempting to get a good paralax effect with the background. My main struggles
really were trying to get my website to format propperly for macs/windows since I am using
a custom font. In addition, I had some borders and flexbox issues since I was trying to combine
groups so it looked nice and could also be reused for sections.
